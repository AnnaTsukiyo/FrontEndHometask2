    <ol>
        <li class="dpdwn"><a><b>HAVE BREAKFAST</b></a>
            <div><a>A nutritious breakfast sets you up with energy for the day,
                    can help you hit your 5-a-day, and can be an easy way to get fibre into your diet</a></div>
        </li>
        <li class="dpdwn"><a><b>EAT A BALANCED DIET</b></a>
            <div><a>Eat from all five food groups, enjoying a wide range of vegetables, fruit,
                    lean meats, fish, eggs, pulses, nuts, seeds, wholegrains and naturally lower-fat dairy foods across
                    each week.</a></div>
        </li>
        <li class="dpdwn"><a><b>CHOOSE NUTRITIOUS CALORIES</b></a>
            <div><a>These come from foods that provide your body with vitamins, minerals, protein, fibre and healthy
                    fats as well as energy; such as vegetables, fruit, nuts, yoghurt and fish.</a></div>
        </li>
        <li class="dpdwn"><a><b>EAT THE RAINBOW </b></a>
            <div><a>Variety is key. Different-coloured veg and fruit contain the different nutrients our bodies need to
                    stay healthy.
                    And try to eat your veg and fruit – rather than drink them – for the full benefits.</div></a>
        </li>
        <li class="dpdwn"><a><b>STAY HYDRATED</b></a>
            <div><a>Water is essential to life. Six to eight glasses of fluid every day is recommended.
                    Water, lower-fat milks, tea and coffee all count (as long as you don’t add sugar).</div></a>
        </li>
        <li class="dpdwn"><a><b>GET COOKING</b></a>
            <div><a>Cooking from scratch is one of the most important life skills we can learn, and is a great way to
                    understand what goes into the meals we eat. Visit jamieoliver.com for lots of recipe inspiration and
                    ideas. </div></a>
        </li>
        <li class="dpdwn"><a><b>READ THE SMALL PRINT</b></a>
            <div><a>Look out for the saturated fat, sugar and salt content in food and drink, as well as recommended
                    portion sizes. The nutrition label on the front of a packet can help you understand exactly what is
                    in the food you buy. </div></a>
        </li>
        <li class="dpdwn"><a><b>EVERYDAY VS OCCASIONAL</b></a>
            <div><a>There’s a place for all types of foods in our diet. Understand the difference between ‘everyday’
                    foods that contribute essential, healthy nutrients and ‘occasional’ foods, such as cakes and
                    pastries. </div></a>
        </li>
        <li class="dpdwn"><a><b> MOVE MORE</b></a>
            <div><a>Staying active is extremely important. It’s recommended that adults aim for at least 150 minutes of
                    moderate physical activity a week – like going for a brisk walk – and children aim for at least 60
                    minutes a day.</div></a>
        </li>
        <li class="dpdwn"><a><b>GET ENOUGH SLEEP</b></a>
            <div><a> Good-quality sleep affects how well we’re able to learn, grow and perform in life. While we’re
                    asleep, our bodies have that all-important time to repair. </div></a>
        </li>
